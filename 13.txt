Lecture 13
==========

Before class:
-------------
1. I read the slides and youtube videos in week 13.
2. Knowledged the concept about Access Control List(ACL), 
3. Knowledged the concept about Restricted Shell.

After class:
------------
Important take-awayis:
- Restricted shell is enforced within the shell;
- different implement ACL differently: linux use getfacl(1)/setfacl(1)/acl(5); macOS use chmod(1)
