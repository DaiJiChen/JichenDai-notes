Lecture 02
==========

Before class:
-------------
I carrefully read the slides of File Descriptors, open(2)/close(2), read(2)/write(2)/close(2), File Sharing.
I watched videos in Youtube channel.
I read the requirements for HW1.

I runned demo codes of week2.

Questions before class:
	1. offset belong to file or belong to read(2) process?

After class:
------------
Answer to questions:
	1.offset belong to file, kernel naintains a file table that records current offset. 

Important take-away:
- Verity the return value after calling every function.
- read(2) and write(2) both begins at the current offset, not the begining of the file.
